Blog
Create a blog site for any area of interest you and your partner share. Consider choosing something you really care about and would like to share with others in the future! You'll start with several static pages, and basic functionality for posts.

Day One

Posts, Basic Routing, Static Pages, Layout and Navigation

Some features to include:

At least two static pages, including an 'about' and 'contact' page.
A navbar or header that includes links to the home, about and contact pages of your blog. It should appear on every page.
Display all posts on the homepage.
Allow the user to add new blog posts.
Allow users an option to update existing posts.
Allow users to delete posts they no longer want on the site.

Blog: Day Two
Comments and Model Relationships

Continue working on the Blog application you and your partner began yesterday. Do not begin working on the functionality listed here until all basic functionality from yesterday's exercise is present.

Allow users to comment on posts. Posts and comments should have a one-to-many relationship.

Features to include:

Allow users to navigate to individual posts and add new comments.
Give users the opportunity to update the content of their comments.
Provide the option to delete comments.
Further exploration
Include a "Recent Comments" feed on the homepage that displays the newest comments (for any/all blog posts) displayed as links. Clicking a link should take the user to the post this comment belongs to.
Add tags to post. Allow users to filter all posts based on tags.
