  "body": "When President George H. W. Bush visited Portland in May 1990, 25 people were arrested after a four-hour confrontation with police. When President Bush visited Portland again in September 1991, 400 protesters showed up. A Bush staffer (it’s not known who) called the city little Beirut, after the violence-torn city of Beirut, Lebanon. Little Beirut has been cited in print since at least September 1991 and Beirut since January 1992. The nickname is still recalled; an August 2003 Associated Press story was titled Little Beirut nickname has stuck.",
